Repository Description: CFD-Python Pipe Pressure Analysis with VTK Visualization

Welcome to the CFD-Python Pipe Pressure Analysis repository! This project provides a powerful Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) application implemented in Python for calculating the pressure distribution at every point within a pipe. It utilizes the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) library to enable intuitive and insightful visualization of the pressure results.

Using advanced numerical methods and fluid dynamics algorithms, this CFD application allows for accurate and efficient pressure analysis of pipe systems. With just a few input parameters such as pipe geometry, flow conditions, and fluid properties, users can obtain detailed pressure data at various points along the pipe.

Key Features:
- CFD-based pipe pressure analysis: Simulate and calculate pressure distribution in pipe systems using computational fluid dynamics techniques.
- Flexible input parameters: Specify pipe geometry, fluid properties, and flow conditions to customize the analysis according to specific scenarios.
- Accurate results: Utilize advanced numerical methods to ensure accurate calculation of pressure at multiple points within the pipe.
- Visualization with VTK: Leverage the power of VTK to visualize pressure distribution in a visually engaging and interactive manner.
- 3D rendering: Generate high-quality 3D representations of the pipe and pressure distribution for enhanced understanding and analysis.

This repository provides the necessary code, documentation, and example datasets to run the CFD-Python application for pipe pressure analysis. The user-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation make it accessible for both researchers and engineers interested in pipe flow analysis.
