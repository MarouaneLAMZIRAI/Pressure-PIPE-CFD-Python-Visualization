# Pressure-PIPE-CFD-Python-Visualization
Welcome to the CFD-Python Pipe Pressure Analysis repository! This project provides a powerful Computational Fluid Dynamics application implemented in Python for calculating the pressure distribution at every point within a pipe. It utilizes the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) to enable intuitive and insightful visualization of the pressure results.
